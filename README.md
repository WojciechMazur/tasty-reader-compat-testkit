# TASTy Reader Compatibility Testkit

This repository tests projects built with a bootstrapped Scala 2 compiler with TASTy reader capabilities.

[TASTy Reader for Scala 2](https://scala.epfl.ch/projects.html#tastyScala2)

The intention is to attempt validate typical code that exists in the real world, and catch issues for further iteration on the TASTy reader.
